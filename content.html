        <p class="about-description">
          I’m an aspiring engineer with a strong foundation in maths and
          physics. I enjoy building things that are technically solid and
          actually useful – from custom PCs and small ventures to more
          structured engineering and data projects.
        </p>
        <p class="about-description">
          Right now I’m focused on developing the skills and experience
          that will get me into top engineering programmes and set me up
          to work on real-world problems in energy, transport, and
          technology.
